    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **console-based Blackjack** game built in Python. The player starts with a certain amount of money (100 by default) and can place bets each round. The program deals cards to both the player and the dealer from a shuffled deck of 52 cards. The player can choose to HIT (take more cards) or STAND (hold their total) until they decide to stop or exceed 21 (bust). The dealer then draws cards until their total is at least 17. The final totals are compared to determine the winner—if the player’s hand is higher (without busting) or the dealer busts, the player wins and gains their bet. Otherwise, the bet is lost, and the player’s money decreases. The game continues until the player chooses to quit or runs out of money. \n"
